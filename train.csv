"I would give no stars if I could. When we received this product it was supposed to be ""new"" but it was clearly used. There were sticky fluids on the drip tray. Also, inside of the water reservoir smelled like wet towel. When I ran it empty, the water did not come out clear, instead there were coffee grounds remaining from whoever used it last. I am EXTREMELY disappointed.Additionally it did not come with some of the included items such as the 4 count K-cup and no extra filters. I am going to definitely return this product. This is really unacceptable.",Complaint re: Product
Works great. Build quality obviously cheap. Buy the 3 year warranty for $7. No clue if it will make 4 cups of coffee for the next three years or not...but who cares if you have a warranty and can replace through Amazon.,Satisfied
Great for an apartment or house where coffee is had occasionally. I love this Keurig because it hold the perfect amount of water to last me a couple of days and it is very versitile. It is not heavy or hard to move. It's easy to use and there are so many k-cup options.Perfect size for 1-3 people drinking coffee or tea moderatley without having to refill the tank every day. I would also reccommend getting the reusable k-cup from Keurig that will allow you to put your own ground coffee in the container and brew a single cup. Best Keurig for the value I believe.,Overjoyed/Praise
"This was a present to me and I couldn't be happier. I've had zero issues with this brewer, making 2-3 cups of coffee daily. Refillable k-cups brew perfectly, so do any disposable k-cup drinks I brew. This model doesn't have the sensor for 'real' kcups which is one of the reasons I chose it. I do wish the water reservoir was a little bigger, but it's not really that big of a deal having to refill it every other day. It sure beats making a pot of drip coffee every morning. I also loved my 4-cup sample pack. 3 coffees and 1 hot chocolate. :) I'm very pleased with this brewer, and I don't have issues with my coffee splattering on the machine like I see some people having. But I generally make the two bigger-sized coffees and the liquid has less distance to drop.",Overjoyed/Praise
We got out first keurig second hand because someone was throwing one away because they got a new one. I would have never bought one new before but now we can't love without it. It makes coffee and tea making so much quicker and easier.  We bought this version for my parents and in-laws after we fell in love with ours. None of us needed anything super fancy so this basic model is great. My husband loves being able to make a cup in the morning even if he's running late because it's so fast and easy. My mom loves it because for the first time in 50yrs she doesn't have to make my dad coffee because he'll do it himself with the keurig.,Overjoyed/Praise
"Been using for a week now and this morning it would not heat so pulled out the manual and there was nothing about what to do about this.  The blue lights came on and I pushed one and it made a very loud noise fro a couple minutes but did not brew.  I turned off, unplugged and waited about 5 minutes and tried again.  This time it worked, so I thought perhaps I'd better register the unit in case I had to have it replaced and read in the manual that the serial number could be found on the bottom of the gift box?, and on the side of the housing behind the water reservoir.  There is no serial number anywhere on the machine and when I unpacked the unit I tossed the box as I do because the serial number is always on the product, so now I have a machine that might be breaking and I will probably not be able to have it repaired or replaced.  In addition, is says it's a K55 but on the bottom it states that it's model K40",Complaint re: Process
"I bought this product on Nov 28th, 2016 (from Amazon.com LLC). The Amazon return window closed on Jan 31, 2017. Guess what... The water stopped filtering through and this Keurig conveniently stopped working on Feb 6, 2017. I even tried running the machine with water several times without a k-cup to no avail. It luckily does carry a 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and I was on the phone nearly an hour with the Keurig Support. The only reason I did not give this a 1 star rating is because Keuring did agree to honor their warranty and send a replacement for their machine. Now it's a wait for 7 more days and a hope that the replacement does work. Although they did replace it, the waste of time and harassment of having to call the coffee maker support within the first 90 days after buying it just isn't worth it.",Complaint re: Process
"We had a K250. The coffee was always warm with high maintenance. It finally stated dumping g a lot of grounds in every cup. We had so many K Cups we had to get another machine. This was top rated on Amazon and it is. Very hot coffee every time, minimal maintenance, like no rinsing after a cup of tea. This makes a great cup of coffee with ease.",Satisfied
This is my third cure. I got the small one first that you had to pour water in for each cup and loved it. Nothing was wrong with it but I wanted a bigger model that had a water reservoir. I wore it out after about 3 1/2 years of daily use. I ordered this one as it look like my old one. However it does not have a programmable timer and clock . I am sure if I'd read the product specifications closer it would've said that but I did not read it well enough. Still I love it. I have not used director coffee pot since my first Keurig.,Satisfied
"Every single cup of coffee smells and tastes like plastic. I followed all of the troubleshooting recommendations, nothing worked. I tried white vinegar, it did not stop the plastic taste. I ran 12 tanks of water through the machine, it did not stop the plastic taste. I searched online for help only to discover that this is an extremely common problem. It has been returned to Amazon for a full refund.",Complaint re: Product
"This is my 4th Keurig coffee maker.  They are made in China.  Quality control is not part of their mfg process.  As a consequence, I get about 18 months of service from my Keurig coffee makers.  I stay with Keurig because I really like the simplicity/variety/quality of coffee I can make with the K-cups",Ambivalent
"I'm a huge fan of this Keurig.  We bought this as an upgrade from a smaller version.  Primarily we wanted a water tank so we could make multiple cups without having to make a trip to the water purifier on our refrigerator.  I only have a few tips to consider...1. If you want a water tank as badly as we did, look for something a bit bigger if they offer it.  I find that I feel like i'm filling this thing up all the time.  I know it's not the case, but I want true lazy mode!2. Make sure you clean it per the instructions every few months, it makes a difference with it's performance.",Overjoyed/Praise

"Simple to use, but my only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't indicate water is needed until after a brew button has been pushed, so if I push the button and walk away I might come back to see the blue refill light on and no coffee in my cup. It should indicate water is needed before I push the button, and not flash the brew buttons unless there is enough water for the largest cup option.",Ambivalent
I purchased this to replace our Keurig at work.  Many of us use coffees with non-standard pods (environmentally friendly top with a tiny bag underneath or a refillable plastic pod)  A Keurig approved pod with bar code is NOT required so you can use any coffee pod. (the Keurig 2.0s require a Keurig brand approved pod so you can't all coffee pods),Satisfied
"We have been dealing with a Mr. Coffee off brand Keurig. Finally sucked it up and purchased this one.So far we love it. The cup sizes are consistent (if not a little smaller than we'd like) and we love that there is a decent sized reservoir.My boyfriend brews with out a k-cup for hot water for his tea, and I use k-cups and a re-usable k-cup, all situations have worked perfectly!",Overjoyed/Praise
"Please DO NOT BUY this Keurig! I will be returning my second one in a matter of months. It first works fine, though noisy, then it just stops making the coffee.

"This model is an upgrade from my previous Keurig. I don't need the fancy programmable screens.  This model is simple, sturdy, attractive and does the job of brewing a hot beverage beautifully. You aren't limited to one brand of k-cups. Every brand I've tried works perfectly.",Overjoyed/Praise
Highly recommend for newly wed or new homes. The only difference with more expensive versions is that they can do k lattes and other sorts which you can brew multiple cups. And i usually find touch screens can usually malfunction. So i decided to go basic and love it!!! Bought the shelving for the k cups and it looks great in my kitchen. Maintenance is super easy which is changing the water filter every 2-3 months. Instructions were pretty easy to follow.,Overjoyed/Praise
"We had the power source,go bad on our last Keurig that we had for at least 3 years. This product we thought would be better since it is a newer model. I hate our new Keurig. It's cheaply made, the hinge that opens for the KCups is weak. The old brewer kept the water hot so when you loaded the KCup it was ready. The new model fills up after you press the dispense button. There is no signal that the water is out until after, so twice now I have walked away and came back to an empty coffee cup because I needed to add water.",Complaint re: Product

I've had previous Keurig machines fail (I always figured it was caused by unfiltered water). But, this time, I took special care to always use filtered water.I'm not sure if Keurig designs their products to fail after a year, or the machines are poorly designed/built. Either way, I think I'm done buying Keurigs for a while.",Complaint re: Product

I am one of the Keurig hold out people. I have held out and not bought one of these thinking it was a frivolous purchase and kinda stupid to be honest. I really love coffee so finally gave in and decided to try this whole deal. OMG I freaking love this thing.

"Been using this Keurig for a couple of months now and it's awesome. Water heats up quickly, coffee is made quickly. Definitely happy with it. The only downside is that while some of the bottom part comes out for cleaning, there's still a piece of plastic down there that means I can't fit my travel mug under it. But I'm not sure if that's because there's not enough room for my travel mug or if I just have a large travel mug, so I just fill up a normal mug twice and dump it into my travel mug and it's all good.",Satisfied

It works perfectly maybe 25% of the time, but the rest of the time when you select the largest cup size the water struggles to come out and you only get a few drops.

We have been using this Keurig K55 for 2 months. I would guess it has made between 5 and 8 cups daily without a single problem. The option to use any k cups was the selling point for us. There are very good options on Amazon for k cup samplers which has been fun sampling serveral different brands and flavors. I would recommend this as an inexpensive option to try a k cup brewer and many different brands of coffee.,Overjoyed/Praise

"I opened the machine, and it is clearly been opened by someone else. I checked the functionality of the machine, and it still works great. However, another thing that really makes me angry is that there were only three K-Cup Pod inside the variety pack that comes with the machine instead of four. The package was clearly opened by someone else, and as the company stated that it should be brand new and unopened box. I am disappointed.",Complaint re: Product

Extremely cheap and flimsy.  This will not go the distance.  They Kept the Keurig name but are producing the bargain basement coffee maker.  Do not waste your money.

Product is working great so far.  Wife is very happy.Side Note:  I bought an additional machine for my mom in law whose Keurig died within weeks of ours.  Her box came with the 4 sample cups but also addtional iced tea cups.  Kinda feel like I got shorted.But that is not a product issue so the five stars stay.,Complaint re: Process
"More proof that R&D departments waste consumers' money. Since these people have to justify their jobs, they've never heard of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The smaller water reservoir is a pain in the butt, particularly since the need water light doesn't appear until AFTER you try to make a cup of coffee. Just what I need when I get out of bed -- more hassle. Of course, anti-development will continue. Wonder what they'll screw up next.",Complaint re: Product
"From day one the lid on our coffee maker will not stay up.  So, you have to hold it up with one hand and insert the Kcup with the other.  PITA.  Now, it has started to only make half cups or less.  It is less than 2 months old.",Complaint re: Product
"This is a little different than the old Keurig I purchased this to replace, but still basically the same (just some different design features, nothing huge). Unfortunately Keurigs appear to be built to break eventually, so I chose to go with one of the cheaper versions, because it's ridiculous to pay more money for a product that will break in about the same amount of time. My parents, my sister, and my roommates have all had a Keurig, and all of them have busted. Ridiculous. I'd pay a lot more for a Keurig that is made with solid parts (maybe less plastic internal parts and more metal) so that it wouldn't break so soon. It just seems wasteful.",Complaint re: Process
"I love being able to make a quick hot cup of coffee, but I do not like paying the high price for the kcups.  I purchased a reusable kcup filter so that I can use my own coffee and not have to purchase the expensive kcups.  It is very messy when I tried using the filter.  I have not used my Keurig in a few weeks because I do not like the mess and do not want to pay the extra cost.  If I could find a filter that works, I would give it 5 stars.",Complaint re: Product
This is my 5th Keurig that has not lasted a year. So disappointed because I loved my morning cup of coffee from it.  I am going to have to find a new brand.  This time my Keurig did not make it a year.  Had a few problems prior to this that I was able to troubleshoot but feel like I really shouldn't have had to do that for the price that you pay.  Disappointed,Complaint re: Product
Replacement lasted less than 2 months and this one is not working now same problem.  Made maybe 10 cups of coffee total.,Complaint re: Product

"I'm annoyed with myself for buying another one of these, some three years after tossing my old one out because of the insipid coffee it makes; i fell for reviews that praised it, and thought that they'd improved it. They haven't. I'm not a coffee snob by any means, but I like strong, black coffee, as many as 10X a day, and the idea of having it readily available is alluring, but this machine makes a weak brew that is completely unsatisfying, across a wide spectrum of dark road K cups I've tried from various manufacturers, so I'm throwing it out, again.",Complaint re: Product
"Wow, this is my second Keurig. Our first one lasted 7 years, so that wasn't bad. But this new one is so much better!! Faster and seems to taste better too.",Overjoyed/Praise
"The electronics on my first K55 did not work properly so I exchanged it for a second machine. The second K55  was also defective so I returned it and bought an iCoffee  Davinci.. I've had the iCoffee  machine for only a short time, but so far so good.",Complaint re: Product
"Bought this from Amazon because it was less than my first one.  After a month or so, it started to act up.... not brewing and making all kinds of weird noises. I wish I can return it but the due date for the return has passed. I will never purchased an appliance online again. You don't really know if what you're getting is brand new or refurbished. Although it says on Amazon if NEW or USED, you can never tell!",Complaint re: Process
At first the convenience was a welcomed change but now I think making a pot of coffee in the morning and having it throughout my day might be preferable.  Plus the expense is even more than I anticipated...I use about 5 cups per day between drinking coffee in the morning and tea or hot chocolate in the evening.,Ambivalent

"My expensive Cuisinart's Keurig died a few months ago and I purchased this one to replace it. I have had it for 3 months, make only 2 cups of coffee per day and its broken already. It appears water won't come through the machine. Its not clogged but because I checked the needle yesterday. To say I am angry is an understatement.  Of course I didn't keep the box it came in. Not pleased at all.....Edited on August 30.  I was planning to toss this Keurig but decided to give  it one more try. I removed the water container, and picked the coffee maker up and placed it down on the counter several times to "" knock the air out""...GENTLY. Replaced the carafe, added water and voil� its working.  I now refuse to remove the container and simply add water with another pitcher.  I believe the problem was an air bubble in one of the lines. I am very pleased with it now.",Satisfied
